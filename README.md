#### Background of the project:
This project is done for the course Distributed Data Infrastructure fall 2020. The course is part of the Masters of Data Science Programme, and the primary purpose of the project was to practice the use of the GraphLab, which was replaced by Turi Create.

#### Used datasets
The dataset was released by Telecom Italia for their Open Big Data Challenge in 2014. It contains telecommunication records, weather, air quality, electricity consumption for city of Milan and province of Trentino in Italy in November and December 2013. You can find detailed description of the dataset from the paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201555.

#### Project questions:
1. Find the most congested communication period of the day in Milan and Trentino.
2. List top 5 Italian provinces which are most called by residents of Milan and Trentino on average.
3. List top 5 languages tweeted by distinct users in Milan. How popular is Finnish as a tweeting language in Milan?
4. Compare call and internet activity between 24th, 25th and 26th December to 26th, 27th, 28th November for Milan. Plot the distribution.
5. Find correlation between user communication activity and different weather conditions (e.g. rain, snow etc.) in Milan and Trentino.
6. Plot the heatmap of user telecommunication activity for both Milan and Trentino. Do you observe any shift in communication pattern of users between day and night? (A typical day time is between 8AM to 8PM)
